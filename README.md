# A better reading level score

This intends to improve on the Flesch-Kincaid reading level scoring system by replacing the syllables per word with an equation based on word frequency in an English corpus.

Very much a work in progress.

### Todo:

* Plot out frequency - syllables finding.
* Use better syllables program.
* Make program that takes in a tokenized corpus and outputs an equation for calculating syllables.
* Write program that takes in a text file and outputs a grade level.
* Improve program to identify problem sentances and problem words.
